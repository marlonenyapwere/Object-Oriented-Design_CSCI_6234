note right of Designer
  The Workflow Designer models business processes
  by defining workflows composed of steps and
  conditional transitions, independent of execution.
end note

note right of Engine
  The Workflow Engine executes workflow instances,
  evaluates conditions at runtime, and maintains
  workflow execution state.
end note

note right of Admin
  The System Administrator maintains and extends
  the engine by adding new step types and system
  configurations without changing the core logic.
end note

note right of UC1
  Define Workflow allows the creation of workflows
  as ordered steps connected by conditional paths.
end note

note right of UC2
  Execute Workflow runs a workflow instance and
  invokes step logic according to defined transitions.
end note

note right of UC3
  Evaluate Conditions determines the next execution
  path based on runtime data.
end note

note right of UC4
  Manage Execution State tracks progress, current
  step, and execution history.
end note

note right of UC5
  Handle Completion / Failure manages successful
  termination and failure scenarios consistently.
end note

note right of UC6
  Extend Workflow Engine enables new step types
  to be added without modifying the core engine.
end note
